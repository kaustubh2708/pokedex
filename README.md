# Modern Pokedex Application

This project is a modernized and enhanced version of the Pokedex application, inspired by [davidhckh/pokedex](https://github.com/davidhckh/pokedex). While maintaining the beautiful UI design of the original project, this version includes several technical improvements and modern development practices.

## üåü Improvements Over Original

### Technical Stack Upgrades
- Migrated from vanilla JavaScript to **TypeScript** for better type safety and developer experience
- Implemented **React** for component-based architecture and better state management
- Added **Redux** with Redux Toolkit for centralized state management
- Configured **Webpack** for modern build process and asset management

### Code Architecture Improvements
- Organized code into a proper component structure
- Separated concerns between data fetching, state management, and UI
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for Pokemon data
- Centralized type definitions and constants
- Implemented proper error handling and loading states

### State Management
- Introduced Redux store for better state management
- Created separate slices for Pokemon data
- Implemented proper actions and reducers
- Added async thunks for API calls

### Component Structure
- Split the application into reusable components:
  - `PokemonList`: Handles the list and search functionality
  - `PokemonDetails`: Displays detailed Pokemon information
  - `App`: Main component handling layout
- Each component is properly typed with TypeScript

### API Integration
- Created a dedicated API service layer
- Improved error handling for API calls
- Added proper loading states
- Implemented better caching of Pokemon data

### Styling Improvements
- Maintained the original beautiful design while improving code structure
- Organized CSS into proper modules
- Added better responsive design handling
- Improved loading animations and transitions

### Developer Experience
- Added proper development tooling
- Implemented ESLint for code quality
- Added TypeScript for better type safety
- Improved project structure for better maintainability
